# Mathematical-Tree-Problem
 We have been working on this mathematical problem at school during the last month. But one day I figured : My programming skill could help, So I made a script that does all the computing and then displays a tree using the anytree library



## Brief explanaition of the problem (in french)

## Before running this script:

First, install the anytree library (you can use the requirements.txt file using the two following commands):

cd (path to your directory)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
